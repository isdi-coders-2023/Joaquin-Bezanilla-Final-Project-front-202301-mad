# MerN Stack Frontend

This frontend application handles the presentation layer for a full stack MERN app focused on Latino foods.

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Custom hooks
- Redux Toolkit
- Styled-components

## Architecture

The app follows a Redux architecture, with features split into separate reducers, actions and selectors. Components can dispatch Redux actions to update the store and re-render with the latest state.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run development server: `npm start`

## Features

- Display list of Latino foods
- Filter foods by cuisine type ( Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc. )
- Add food items
- Edit food items
- Delete food items
- Edit food items

## API Interactions

The frontend makes requests to a backend API handled by the MerN stack to persist data and manage the food listings. This is a seperate repo.

## Next Steps

- Add authentication
- Allow users to post reviews for foods
- Explore food categories in more detail
- Improve styling and UX
